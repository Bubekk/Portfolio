        Seems like you're trying to load this page on a mobile device or test my RWD skills. Don't do that, please. Give it another go on a good old
        PC or laptop.

        If this is your first encounter with this message, as mentioned earlier, give it a shot on a PC or laptop, or hop over to this link for my
        'professional' portfolio.

        Here's where some quirky technical info usually appears, nobody really understands, even the XP creators, I suspect. I'll throw it in for the
