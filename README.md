# Portfolio in Windows 98 Style - React Project

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project is a homage to the classic Windows 98 user interface, built using React. It includes a functional calculator and a start menu, both with the retro Windows 98 look and feel.

## Project Status

I'm actively working on this project and plan to add several exciting features in the future. This is an ongoing effort to recreate the nostalgic experience of using Windows 98 right in your web browser.

## Features

- **Calculator:** A fully functional calculator with the appearance of the classic Windows 98 calculator.
- **Start Menu:** A start menu that mimics the Windows 98 start menu, providing access to various sections of my portfolio.
- **Desktop Icons:** The desktop icons are interactive; you can double-click them to trigger actions or navigate to different parts of the portfolio.

## Upcoming Features

Here are some of the features I'm planning to add in the near future:

- **Additional Apps:** More apps and tools styled in the Windows 98 theme.
- **Customization Options:** The ability to customize the desktop background and color scheme.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance this project!
